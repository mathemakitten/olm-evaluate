Background: The Polynesian Maori reached New Zealand sometime between A.D. 1250 and 1300. In 1840, their chieftains entered into a compact with Great Britain, the Treaty of Waitangi, in which they ceded sovereignty to Queen Victoria while retaining territorial rights. The British colony of New Zealand became an independent dominion in 1907. In recent years, the government has sought to address longstanding Maori grievances.The Polynesian Maori reached New Zealand sometime between A.D. 1250 and 1300.
