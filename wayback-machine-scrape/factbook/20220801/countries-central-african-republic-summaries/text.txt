Background: The French colony of Ubangi-Shari became the Central African Republic upon independence in 1960. After three tumultuous decades of misrule - mostly by military governments - civilian rule was established in 1993 but lasted only a decade. Peace agreements signed in 2017 and 2019 between the government and armed factions have had little effect and armed groups operate openly.The French colony of Ubangi-Shari became the Central African Republic upon independence in 1960.
