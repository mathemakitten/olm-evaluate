This entry describes one of the two major surface hydrological features of a country: large localized water bodies termed lakes (the other feature is rivers). The entry contains a list of major natural lakes, defined as having an area of 500 sq km or greater. Taken together with major rivers, these features constitute the primary sources of surface freshwater.
