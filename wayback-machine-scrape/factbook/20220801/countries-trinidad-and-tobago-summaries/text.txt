Background: First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came under British control in the early 19th century. The islands' sugar industry was manned by contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962.First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came under British control in the early 19th century.
