Topic: June 16, 2022Did you know that Antarctica contains more water than any other continent? The only problem is that it is all ice! Some 99% of the land area is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, the largest single mass of ice on earth covering an area of 14 million sq km (5.4 million sq mi) and containing 26.5 million cu km (6.4 million cu mi) of ice (this is almost 62% of all of the world’s fresh water). If all this ice were converted to liquid water, one estimate is that it would be sufficient to raise the height of the world’s ocean by 58 m (190 ft).

Topic: June 9, 2022For the five World oceans – Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, and Southern – a “Volume” entry was recently added that not only presents the estimated volume of each of the oceans in million cubic kilometers, but also the percent of the World Ocean total volume. For example, the Indian Ocean’s 264 million cu km volume represents 19.8% of the volume of all of the World’s oceans.

Topic: June 2, 2022You are visiting a new country and trying to determine what would be a perfect memento of your trip. The World Factbook can help you decide. The Travel Facts page for every country now includes a Souvenirs section that lists favorite items that visitors like to procure. For example, in Nepal common souvenirs include: knotted/woven carpets and hemp items, wool pashminas, sheepskin slippers, woven caps, kukri knives, precious metal and turquoise jewelry, sacred scroll paintings, wood instruments, lokta bark paper, tea, and kitchen spices.

Topic: May 26, 2022In the Environment category, the “Food insecurity” field was recently updated with first quarter 2022 information for 44 – mostly African and Asian – countries where access to food supplies remains a concern. While there have been no significant changes, lingering effects of COVID-19 restrictions are still apparent. More ominously, the ongoing Ukraine war is preventing grain deliveries and raising warnings of an impending global food crisis.

Topic: May 19, 2022A second batch of larger and more detailed country maps was recently added to the Factbook. The new countries include: The Bahamas, Benin, Cameroon, Cuba, Denmark, Egypt, Gabon, Kyrgyzstan, Montenegro, and North Korea.

Topic: May 12, 2022Several key demographic fields in the People and Society category have been updated with 2022 data.  These fields are:  “Life expectancy at birth,” “Total fertility rate,” “Infant mortality rate,” and “Sex ratio.”

Topic: May 5, 2022In late March of this year, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in Africa, as well as for a few Middle Eastern countries. While wild or naturally occurring polio has been virtually eradicated worldwide, a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) has become a concern. VDPV is a strain of the weakened poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine and that has changed over time and behaves like the wild or naturally occurring virus. This means that it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come into contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an “infected” person who received oral polio vaccine. The CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccination series. The CDC recommendations may be found in the “Major infectious diseases” entry in the People and Society section of the 24 Sub-Saharan African (and miscellaneous other) countries where VDPV is a threat.

Topic: April 28, 2022An important new field providing data on the prevalence of “Child marriage” has been added to the People and Society category. Girls who marry early tend to drop out of school and often have early, higher-risk pregnancies. Child brides are also at risk of abuse, exploitation, and separation from relatives and family.

Topic: April 21, 2022In the Military and Security section, the “Maritime threat” entry – which describes piracy threats – was recently updated with 2021 numbers. Overall, there was a significant drop in incidents world-wide over 2020 (195) to 132 for 2021; this is the lowest number since 1994.  The Gulf of Aden remained quiet and West African incidents were down considerably. Areas that showed an increase in attacks were the Singapore Straits and the Western Hemisphere.

Topic: April 14, 2022Several population-growth-related fields in the People and Society category have been updated with 2022 data.  These fields are: “Population,” “Population growth rate,” “Birth rate,” “Death rate,” and “Net migration rate.”

Topic: April 7, 2022In the Military and Security category, the “Military equipment inventories and acquisitions” field was recently updated with the latest available information from 2021.

Topic: March 31, 2022Appendix H: Strategic Materials, which lists all of the compounds, metals, non-metals, and rare earth elements deemed to be of critical importance to US national security, has been updated. The US is 100% import reliant for 14 of the 59 elements listed as Strategic Materials. The US gets between 19-25 commodities from China, 13-18 commodities from Canada, 10 from South Africa, 9 from Brazil, 8 from India, and 6 from Russia. The economic slowdown associated with COVID-19 affected global production of many commodities in 2020, but that slackening began to recover in 2021.

Topic: March 24, 2022The World Factbook is delighted to announce the inclusion of 24 new country maps – the first tranche in what will be a series of cartographic updates. The new maps, larger in size and more detailed than previous versions, may be found for the following countries/territories: Afghanistan, Algeria, American Samoa, Antarctica, Australia, China, Republic of the Congo, Iceland, India, Iran, Japan, Kazakhstan, Laos, Mongolia, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal, Spain, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.

Topic: March 17, 2022In the Military and Security category, the “Military expenditures” field was recently updated with the latest available information.

Topic: March 10, 2022Information on drinking water and sanitation has been updated for 2020; both of these subjects are key indicators of social and economic development.  Both the “Drinking water source” and “Sanitation facility access” fields (in the People and Society section) are categorized as ‘improved’ or ‘unimproved’ and include data for rural, urban, and total populations.  Over 90% of the world’s population has access to improved drinking water sources, while almost 70% of the world’s population has access to improved sanitation facilities.

Topic: March 3, 2022Have a look this week at the population pyramids (under People and Society > “Age structure”) all of which have recently been updated for 2022. Population pyramids illustrate the age and sex structure of a country’s population. Pyramids that are wider at the bottom and get progressively narrower toward the top are typical of youthful populations, while pyramids that are barrel-shaped characterize more mature populations. Population pyramids can provide insights about political and social stability, as well as economic development.

Topic: February 24, 2022Substantial quantities of new photos have recently been added to the following World Factbook entries: Angola, Cuba, Djibouti, Liberia, Nepal, Rwanda, Serbia, and Taiwan.

Topic: February 17, 2022In the People and Society category, the “Urbanization” field, which shows the estimated proportion of a country’s population living in urban areas, has been updated with 2022 data. The “Major urban areas – population” field, which provides the estimated population of up to six of a country’s largest urban centers over 750,000 people, has also been updated. For those countries with no metropolis  of 750,000 or more, the estimated population of only the capital has been provided.

Topic: February 10, 2022The World Factbook is delighted to unveil its latest field this week entitled “National heritage,” which introduces a country’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The first subfield in this new entry – found in the Government section – lists how many sites are present in a country and whether they are cultural or natural or both. The second subfield lists up to 10 or so selected sites in a country. Most countries have fewer than 10 or 12 sites, but some (mostly larger) countries contain many dozen. The United States currently has 24 inscribed sites. Where possible, links have been set up from a listed site to a photo from The World Factbook‘s photo collection.

Topic: February 3, 2022The “Military service age and obligation” field has been expanded where possible with information on the approximate numbers or percentages of conscripts in a country’s military. Additionally, the percentages of women in the military have been added where that data is available.

Topic: January 27, 2022There are 195 independent countries in the World; amazingly, 80 of them (41% !) have names beginning with one of only four letters (at least in the English language): B (18, Bahamas to Burundi), C (18, Cambodia to Czechia), M (18, Macedonia to Mozambique), and S (24, Saint Kitts and Nevis to Syria). All other letters except W and X begin the name of at least one country.

Topic: January 20, 2022Last week the uninhabited island of Hunga Tonga in the Tongan archipelago began to erupt. Located 65 km (40 mi) north of Tongatapu, Tonga’s main island, it is part of the highly active Tonga–Kermadec Islands volcanic arc in the South Pacific. The eruption caused damaging tsunamis along the entire rim of the Pacific Ocean but, fortunately, loss of life has been low. The explosion is the largest of the 21st century to date.

Topic: January 13, 2022Appendix B: International Organizations and Groups has been completely updated and includes several new entries (e.g., Forum for the Progress of South America and Wassenaar Arrangement), as well as their contact information (address, phone, fax). In addition, email and website addresses have been added for most organizations.

Topic: January 06, 2022Appendix T: Terrorist Organizations has been updated with the latest information from the US State Department’s just-published Country Terrorism Review. All Appendix T entries are now up to at least 2020 and most are 2021. Included are two new foreign terrorist organizations: the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People’s Army (FARC-EP) and Segunda Marquetalia.

Topic: December 30, 2021Have you ever heard of AOSIS? The acronym stands for the Alliance of Small Island States. Established in 1990, it is an intergovernmental organization of 39 small island and low-lying coastal countries that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. AOSIS has been very active from its inception and has played a leading role in global forums in raising awareness on climate change and in advocating for action to address climate change. To find out more about AOSIS, or about any of more than 200 other international organizations, go to References and click on Appendix B: International Organizations and Groups.

Topic: December 16, 2021In the five Oceans entries, the “Marine fisheries” field – in the Environment category – has been updated with the latest available 2019 FAO numbers. Overall, the rankings did not change significantly. The Pacific Ocean remains the largest fishery with 57.8% of total global catch, followed by the Atlantic (26.4%), and Indian Oceans (15.3%). Herrings, sardines, and anchovies make up 24% of the global catch of marine fishes.

Topic: December 9, 2021In the Transportation category, the “Merchant marine” entry has been updated for all countries that have a merchant fleet.

Topic: December 2, 2021On 30 November 2021, the Caribbean island nation of Barbados became a republic, transitioning from a parliamentary constitutional monarchy to a parliamentary republic with a ceremonial elected president as head of state. The prime minister remains head of government and the country continues its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations. The date marked the 55th anniversary of Barbados achieving its independence from the UK in 1966.

Several large countries have multiple river entries: Brazil with 7, Canada 10, China 10, India 9, Russia 9, and the US 11.

Topic: October 28, 2021The World Factbook is pleased to announce an enhancement to its 223 One-Page Summaries, which now include a brief country/territory Introduction and an Economic Overview snapshot to accompany the latest economic data. In addition, the Government, Geography, and People and Society fields have all been updated where possible.

Topic: October 21, 2021The US Government designates 16 countries as Major Non-NATO Allies (MNNA) with which it has strategic working relationships in the areas of defense trade and security cooperation. The countries are: Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, and Tunisia.

Topic: September 23, 2021Did you know there really is a Robinson Crusoe Island? From 1704 to 1709, the island was home to a marooned sailor, Alexander Selkirk, who at least partially inspired novelist Daniel Defoe’s fictional Robinson Crusoe in his 1719 novel. Today some 850 people live on the island, which received its current name in 1966 to reflect its literary connection and to promote tourism. To find out where the island is located, what it was formerly called, and to what country it belongs, check the Factbook‘s Appendix F: Geographic Names.

Topic: September 16, 2021The troy weight system is primarily used in the precious metals industry (e.g., the troy ounce is a traditional unit of gold weight). So, how would someone convert from troy pounds to kilograms? Find out by visiting The World Factbook‘s Weights and Measures page (Appendix G) and scrolling down to either kilograms or pounds, troy.

Topic: September 9, 2021Rare earth elements or REEs are 17 chemical elements that are critical in many of today’s high-tech industries. Typical applications for REEs include batteries in hybrid cars, fiber optic cables, flat panel displays, and permanent magnets, as well as some defense and medical products. Appendix H: Strategic Materials includes detailed information on 16 of these elements, including facts describing the elements, their uses, import sources and import quantities, world resources, and any available substitutes. (The only REE not included is Promethium, which exists only in miniscule, economically insignificant quantities.)

Did you know that the World entry also has national anthem information? Listed in that entry are distinctive or exceptional anthems, such as the world’s oldest anthem, the world’s shortest anthem, the countries with two official anthems, etc. Visit the World entry to learn what all these remarkable anthems are.

Topic: May 13, 2021Trade data fields for “Imports – commodities,” “Exports – commodities,” “Imports – partners,” and “Exports – partners” have been updated for all countries and territories. This update includes trade data for smaller territories that The World Factbook had not previously reported.

Topic: May 6, 2021In the World entry, the airport traffic numbers in the Transportation category have been updated with preliminary 2020 data and they present a dramatically different scenario due to COVID-19 restrictions. Passenger traffic through the top ten airports declined 45.7% in 2020 and for all airports globally dropped am amazing 64.6%. Atlanta, which had been the busiest passenger airport for more than 20 years, is now number two. Seven of the top ten airports for passenger traffic are in China and the other three are in the US. Most of the new rankings are due to domestic flights in China; when global traffic opens up again the old passenger patterns should reemerge.In contrast, air cargo traffic in the top ten airports grew by 3% in 2020 and the rank order was largely unchanged. Memphis, TN surpassed Hong Kong to become the busiest cargo airport. All told, the top ten cargo airports handled 28% of global air cargo.

Topic: April 29, 2021In the Military and Security category, the following fields have been updated with the latest 2020 or 2021 data/information: “Military and security forces,” “Military and security service personnel strengths,” “Military deployments,” and “Military equipment inventories and acquisitions.”

Topic: May 21, 2020Did you know that more than three-quarters of the world’s countries have a maritime boundary of some sort. As such, they have an exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which is a sea zone – set forth by the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea – over which a country has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources. An EEZ stretches from a country’s mean-low tide baseline at its coast out to 200 nautical miles. Most maps do not show EEZs, but The World Factbook’s World Oceans map does (under the References tab>Regional and World Maps>World Oceans; the PDF version is the most informative, particularly when enlarged). More than one-third of the world’s ocean area falls within an EEZ.

The World Factbook will incorporate the new name throughout its database after the US State Department receives an official diplomatic notification from the Macedonian Government and after the name has been approved by the US Board on Geographic Names – all of which should take place within the next few days.Other country name changes of the 21st century include last year’s name change of Swaziland to Eswatini, the Czech Republic adopting the short-form name of Czechia in 2016, Cape Verde formalizing the Portuguese use of its name Cabo Verde for all official purposes in 2013, and East Timor adopting the name of Timor-Leste shortly after attaining independence in 2002.
