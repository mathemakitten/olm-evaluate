This entry describes one of the two major surface hydrological features of a country: large flowing bodies of water termed rivers (the other feature is lakes). The entry includes a list of major rivers, defined as having a length of 1,000 km or greater. These rivers constitute major drainage basins or watersheds that capture the flow of the majority of surface water flow. Taken together with major lakes, these features constitute the primary sources of surface freshwater.
In instances where a river flows through more than one country, a note has been added to the field to indicate the country where the river starts and the country where a river ends. [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth.
