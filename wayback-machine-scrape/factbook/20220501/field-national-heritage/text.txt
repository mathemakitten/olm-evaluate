World Heritage Sites are designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which seeks to encourage the identification, protection, and preservation of cultural, historic, scientific, and natural heritage sites around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. This entry includes two subfields: total World Heritage Sites and selected World Heritage Site locales. The former consists of natural sites, cultural sites, and mixed (natural and cultural) sites in a country; the latter presents a representative sample of the sites found within a country.
