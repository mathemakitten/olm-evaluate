This entry provides information on access to electricity. Electrification data – collected from industry reports, national surveys, and international sources – consists of four subfields. Population without electricity provides an estimate of the number of citizens that do not have access to electricity. Electrification – total population is the percent of a country’s total population with access to electricity, electrification – urban areas is the percent of a country’s urban population with access to electricity, while electrification – rural areas is the percent of a country’s rural population with access to electricity. Due to differences in definitions and methodology from different sources, data quality may vary from country to country.
