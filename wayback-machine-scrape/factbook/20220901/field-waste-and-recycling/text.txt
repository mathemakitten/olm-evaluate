This entry provides the amount of municipal solid waste a country produces annually and the amount of that waste that is recycled. Municipal solid waste consists of everyday items that are used and thrown away, including product packaging, furniture, clothing, bottles, food scraps, newspapers, grass clippings, appliances, paint, and batteries. Municipal solid waste - often referred to as trash or garbage - comes from homes, schools, hospitals, and businesses. Recycling is the process of collecting and processing materials that would otherwise be thrown away as trash and turning them into new products. Recycling benefits both communities and the environment.
This entry includes three subfields: annual amount of municipal solid waste generated (tons), annual amount of municipal solid waste recycled (tons), and percent of municipal solid waste recycled.This entry provides the amount of municipal solid waste a country produces annually and the amount of that waste that is recycled.
