This entry provides the long-term average water availability for a country measured in cubic meters per year of precipitation, recharged ground water, and surface inflows from surrounding countries.  Total renewable water resources provides the water total available to a country but does not include water resource totals that have been reserved for upstream or downstream countries through international agreements.  Note that these values are averages and do not accurately reflect the total available in any given year.  Annual available resources can vary greatly due to short-term and long-term climatic and weather variations.This entry provides the long-term average water availability for a country measured in cubic meters per year of precipitation, recharged ground water, and surface inflows from surrounding countries.  Total renewable water resources provides the water total available to a country but does not include water resource totals that have been reserved for upstream or downstream countries through international agreements.  Note that these values are averages and do not accurately reflect the total available in any given year.  Annual available resources can vary greatly due to short-term and long-term climatic and weather variations.
