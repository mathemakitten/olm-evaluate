Background: Carib Indians inhabited Grenada when Christopher COLUMBUS landed on the island in 1498, but it remained uncolonized for more than a century. The French settled Grenada in the 17th century and Britain took the island in 1762 establishing sugar, cacao, and then nutmeg plantations. Independence was attained in 1974, making Grenada one of the smallest independent countries in the Western Hemisphere.Carib Indians inhabited Grenada when Christopher COLUMBUS landed on the island in 1498, but it remained uncolonized for more than a century.
